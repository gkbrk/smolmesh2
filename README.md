# Smolmesh2

Welcome to Smolmesh2! üåê

Smolmesh2 is a powerful mesh networking tool written in Rust that allows nodes to communicate over various transports while maintaining a decentralized and resilient network structure. It supports Linux and Windows operating systems and includes several key features to facilitate seamless communication and network stability.

## Features

- **IPv4 and IPv6 Support:** Handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with automatic route management
- **Multiple Transports:** Supports legacy TCP connections, both for connecting and listening using encrypted channels
- **TUN/TAP Interface:** Integrates with TUN/TAP interfaces on Linux and Wintun on Windows to manage network traffic
- **Packet Routing and Broadcasting:** Efficiently routes packets to their destinations using fastest path discovery and broadcasts node availability
- **Automatic Path Discovery:** Discovers and maintains optimal paths between nodes
- **Encrypted Communications:** All communications are encrypted using the SPECK cipher for lightweight but effective security
- **Duplicate Packet Detection:** Prevents packet loops using efficient packet tracking with hash-based detection
- **Asynchronous Architecture:** Custom async runtime (leo_async) for efficient I/O operations
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Works on both Linux and Windows with platform-specific networking implementations

## Commands

- **help, --help:** Show help message with available commands
- **meshnode [config-file]:** Runs the mesh node with the specified configuration file
- **name-to-ipv6 [node-name]:** Converts a node name to its corresponding IPv6 address
- **make-random-ipv4:** Generates a random IPv4 address
- **make-random-ipv6:** Generates a random IPv6 address with fd00::/8 prefix

## Usage

To start a mesh node, run:
```bash
cargo run -- meshnode config.json
```
This will initialize the node using the configuration specified in `config.json`. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for details.

## Configuration

The configuration file (`config.json`) should include details such as node name, IP addresses, and transport methods. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "node_name": "example_node",
  "linux_tuntap": true,
  "transports": [
    {
      "type": "legacy_tcp_connect",
      "host": "example.com",
      "port": 12345,
      "key": "encryption_key_here"
    },
    {
      "type": "legacy_tcp_listen",
      "port": 54321,
      "keys": ["allowed_key1", "allowed_key2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Optional fields:
- `ipv4_addresses`: Array of IPv4 addresses this node should handle (e.g., `["192.168.1.1"]`)
- `windows_tuntap`: Boolean to enable Windows TUN/TAP support (default: false)

## Platform-Specific Features

### Linux
- Uses native TUN/TAP interfaces for virtual network adapters
- Automatically configures IP routes and interface settings
- Requires TUN/TAP kernel support

### Windows
- Uses Wintun driver for virtual network adapter functionality
- Automatically configures IPv6 addresses for the virtual adapter
- Requires the Wintun driver (wintun-amd64.dll) in the working directory

## Technical Details

### Network Protocol
- Uses a custom packet format with timestamp, command type, and payload
- Supports node discovery, IP address broadcasting, and data transfer
- Implements duplicate packet detection to prevent loops

### Security
- All transport connections are encrypted using the SPECK cipher
- Uses challenge-response authentication for connection establishment
- Implements MAC (Message Authentication Code) for packet integrity

### Networking
- Custom async networking stack for efficient I/O operations
- Supports non-blocking socket operations
- Implements timeout handling for network operations

## Dependencies

### System Requirements
- **Linux:** TUN/TAP kernel support (usually available by default)
- **Windows:** Wintun driver (wintun-amd64.dll) in the working directory
